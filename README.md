# X-X-matrix-elements-with-CUDA
CUDA-accelerated 10-dimensional Monte-Carlo integration with parallel sum reduction for calculating exciton-exciton scattering matrix elements.

For this program to work you need to handle your exciton wave functions properly, or send me a message if you'd like me to send some over.
